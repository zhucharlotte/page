    <h2><a href="../_talks/Carbon_Emissions.html">Research on the Impact of Corporate Digital Transformation on Carbon Emissions</a></h2>
    <p><em>Accepted by the Journal of Wuhan Business University(ISSN2095-7955)</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Empirically explored how digital transformation reduces carbon emissions by improving production efficiency and resource allocation.</li>
        <li>Analyzed the moderating effects of environmental management reforms and internal corporate governance.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2><a href="../_talks/CNN.html">Research on a Financial Fraud Identification Model by Fusing a Convolutional Neural Network</a></h2>
    <p><em>Revised by PLOS ONE(IF:2.9)</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Proposed a financial fraud identification model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).</li>
        <li>Analyzed the feature contributions and correlations, and visualized them.</li>
        <li>Compared the performance of CNN-SVM with LR, RF, XGBoost, and SVM, and performed statistical testing.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2><a href="../_talks/Networks.html">Shareholder Relationship Networks, Information Advantages, and Corporate Digital Transformation</a></h2>
    <p><em></em>Revised by Humanities and Social Sciences Communications(IF:3.7)</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Empirically studied the impact of shareholder relationship networks on the digital transformation of Chinese listed companies.</li>
        <li>Found that these networks positively influenced digital transformation through "information advantages," especially among stable institutional investors.</li>
        <li>Weakened the effect in state-owned enterprises due to policy burdens, but compensation incentives strengthened it.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2><a href="../_talks/Green_Agricultural.html">Evaluation of Effectiveness and Impact of Green Agricultural Policies — A Quantitative Analysis Based on China's Policy Texts (2017–2022)</a></h2>
    <p><em>Being submitted to Scientific Reports(IF:3.8)</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Used the SBM-GML model to calculate the green total factor productivity of agriculture in China.</li>
        <li>Established a multiple regression model to conduct a quantitative analysis of China's green agricultural policy from the perspective of policy texts.</li>
        <li>Found that supply-side policy tools have a significant positive impact on agricultural green total factor productivity, while environmental policy tools have the opposite effect.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2><a href="../_talks/Photovoltaic.html">Assessment of the Effectiveness and Impact of Photovoltaic Industry Policies: A Quantitative Analysis Based on Policy Texts from China (2005–2023)</a></h2>
    <p><em>Being submitted to Sustainability(IF:3.3)</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantified and analyzed policies related to China's photovoltaic industry.</li>
        <li>Used the SBM-GML model to measure Green Total Factor Productivity (GTFP).</li>
        <li>Conducted empirical analysis on the impact of policy tools on GTFP.</li>
        <li>Found that both supply-side and demand-side policy tools had a significant positive effect on Green Total Factor Productivity.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2><a href="../_talks/XGBoost.html">Construction of a Disease Prediction Model Based on the XGBoost Model</a></h2>
    <p><em>Course paper</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyzed and processed medical data, and constructed a disease prediction model by leveraging the advantages of XGBoost.</li>
        <li>Used SHAP to visualize feature contributions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2><a href="../_talks/LightGBM.html">The Application of Media Coverage in Financial Fraud Warning—Based on Bayesian Optimized LightGBM Model Construction and Empirical Research</a></h2>
    <p><em>Ongoing</em></p>
